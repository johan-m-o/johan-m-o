Hi, I'm Johan and I am a math and technology teacher that loves to tinker. You'll find some of my projects on <a rel="me" href="https://codeberg.org/johan-m-o">Codeberg</a>.  

A list of ideas and projects in progress can be found here:

Sometimes I create designs for 3D-printing. Those will be published on Printables:
